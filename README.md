# CompressedRewrite

A Minecraft mod created to allow you to compress different items for easy Storage.

A very small mod that compresses some of the most common blocks in Vanilla Minecraft. This is similar to what Extra Utilities does with Cobblestone, Dirt, Gravel and Sand. Except this mod covers way more blocks than that. In the future, it will add support for common Mod blocks as well.
